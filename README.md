# Midterm Project: EasyDraw

**Team Members**: Earl Jay Caoile, Shubham Majumdar, Tammy Ip

## Project description

Our application allows two viewers to look at the same document on their own web browser, while one user is making changes on a document, those will be reflected on the other personâ€™s browser simultaneously. Our drawing tool allows the user to create and manipulate lines, shapes, colors, and text to your documents.
